Independently of which application area, data preprocessing is a required step.

1. Adjust dataset dimensions to the problem's dimensions and shapes
2. Centering and standardizing the dataset: substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array
3. Dimensionality reduction
4. Feature selection
