Object storage: stores arbitrary objects with a unique key.

Cloud storage: no need to provision ahead of time.

Each object has a URL.

Composed of buckets. When we create a bucket, we give a globally unique name, a geographical region to store the bucket, and a default storage class.

Objects in the storage are immutable, meaning we do not edit them, instead we create new versions of them.

Cloud IAM to control access to objects and buckets.

ACLs offer finer control and define who has access to buckets and objects, as well as what level of access they have.

ACLs are composed of two parts: (1) scope, defining who can perform the specified actions, and (2) permission, defining which actions can be performed by those within the scope.

Lifecycle management policies: delete objects older than X days, or keep only the X most recents versions of an object, and so on.

# Storage classes

Regional, multi-regional, nearline, and coldline.

Regional, multi-regional: high-performance

nearline, and coldline: archive and backup: costs per GB of data read

Multi-regional: georedundant, costs more. Better for frequently accessed data.
Regional: not georedundant, costs less for GB of data stored. Used more to store data close to Compute Engines, VMs, or Kubernetes engine clusters.

Nearline: access once a month or less on average.
Coldline storage: low cost, for access once a year. Has a 90-day minimum storage duration, higher per-operation costs.

Cloud storage can also start startup scripts, Compute Engine images, and objects used by Compute Engine applcations.
