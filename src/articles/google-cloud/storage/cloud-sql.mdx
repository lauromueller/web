MySQL and PostgreSQL databases as a service.

Schema + transactions.

Benefits over storing DB in a VM:
* Several replica services such as read, failover, and external replicas. In an outage occurs, Cloud SQL can replicate data between multiple zones with automatic failover. 
* Backup data with on-demand or scheduled backups.
* Scale vertically (change machine type) and horizontally (by creating read replicas)
* Network firewalls and customer data is encrypted.
* Accessible by other GCP services and external services.
