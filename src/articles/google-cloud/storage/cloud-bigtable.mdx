NoSQL, big data data service.

Single lookup key.

Same API as Apache HBase.

Benefits of Bigtable: scalability, management of administration tasks like upgrades and restarts transparently. All data in Cloud Bigtable is encrypted in both in-flights and at rest.

IAM permissions can be used to control who has access to Bigtable data.
