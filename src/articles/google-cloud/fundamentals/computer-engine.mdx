Create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. No upfront investments.

Also GPU's available.

Persistent storage: standard or SSD.

We can create a startup script to the VM that will run when the VM starts.

Preemtible VMs can be terminated by compute engine if its resources are needed elsewhere. This works best if we defined a job that can stopped and started without loss of information.

Autoscaling: add and take away VMs base on load metrics.

Load balancing between the different active VMs.
