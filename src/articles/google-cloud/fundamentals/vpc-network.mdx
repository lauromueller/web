A VPC connects the Google Cloud Platform resources between each other and to the internet.

Each VPC network is contained in a GCP project.

It is possible to provision Google Platform resources, connect them to each other, and isolate them from one another.

It is possible to segment the networks, use firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.

The VPCs have global scope. They can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide and subnets can span the zones that make up that region. We can have resources in different zones of the same subnet

VPCs have routing tables used to forward traffic from one instance to another instance within the same network. Firewall instances are also provided in a VPC and are global and distributed. Their job is to restrict access to instances, both incoming and outgoing traffic. We can define firewall rules based on metadata tags on Compute Engine instances. For example, we can tag "web" in several VMs and create a firewall rule that allows incoming web traffic on ports 80 and 443 only for those VMs tagged with "web". 

VPC Peering to establish peering between VPCs so that they can exchange information.

Shared VPCs.
