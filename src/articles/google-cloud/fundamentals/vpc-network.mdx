A VPC connects the Google Cloud Platform resources between each other and to the internet.

Each VPC network is contained in a GCP project.

It is possible to provision Google Platform resources, connect them to each other, and isolate them from one another.

It is possible to segment the networks, use firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.

The VPCs have global scope. They can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide and subnets can span the zones that make up that region.
