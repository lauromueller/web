Welcome to the first article in a series of posts that will take a deep dive
into the basic concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms in computer programming.
The goal of this course is to cover the grounds of data structures and algorithms
that are relevant despite the language your are working with because they deal
with something more fundamental than a specific language: they deal with the
logical process involved in understanding and designing software. We do, however,
need a specific programming language so that we can actually implement what
we discuss here, and I have decided to go with Java for this one ("what? Dude,
use Python", you might be shouting. The problem is, I'm not asking for your
opinion neither need I give any explanation for my choice... So let's move on).

As a starting point, I want to discuss some topics related to general software
development. Let's discuss three phases that will always be present, no matter
which development project you are involved in.

## The three major steps in software development

When working with Java, we inevitably stumble upon the concept of object-oriented
programming, which is a programming language model in which our program is
organized around objects which have certain attributes and behaviors. This
rises the important concern of how to define the objects and how to organize their
interactions.

### Design

The design step is one of the most important phases of object-oriented programming.
Here we dedicate time and effort to dividing our program into classes, defining
both the information and methods that will be stored in each class, as well as
how each class will interact with each other. While this is highly dependent on
the program being implemented, there are a couple of general principles we can
keep in mind:

#### Actors and responsibilities define the classes of our programs

### Coding

### Testing
