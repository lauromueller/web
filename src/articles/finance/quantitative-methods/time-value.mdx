  One of the main concerns of investors and financial analysts when placing
  money in any security is to determine how much the future stream of cash flows
  coming from that security is worth. The time value of money is one of the
  aspects that shape how future cash flows are valued. Having one hundred
  dollars today is preferable to having one hundred dollars in one year's time,
  since we have the possibility of immediately using the money, for example, to
  collect interests over the period and have more than one hundred dollars in
  one year. In this article we will deal with interpreting the concept of
  interest rates, how interest rates and risk are related, and how we can use
  interest rates to calculate the future and the present value of money.

[WRITE SOME INTRODUCTION?]
Understanding how to calculate the **time value of money** requires familiarity with a couple of concepts, among which **interest rates** and their interpretation are specially important.

## The concept of interest rates

The starting point for the discussion about **time value of money** is the concept of **interest rates**. If someone approached you and offered an investment opportunity that required you to pay $$ \$1.000,00 $$ today to receive $$ \$1.000,00 $$ one year from now, would you go for it? Probably not. After all, freezing your money for an entire year without any form of compensation does not bring any benefit to you. You would be better off by keeping the money in your account and spending it gradually over the period, with as much flexibility over the expenditure as you want (and as $$ \$1.000,00 $$ allow you to buy). The fact that money is worth different amounts today and one year from now leads to the need for ways of discounting or valuing money over time. How much would you require from your investment one year from now so that you are willing to freeze the $$ \$1.000,00 $$ today? $$ \$1.020,00 $$? $$ \$1.050,00 $$?

The fact that there is a certain value $$ (\$1.000,00 + x) $$ that would make you willing to invest your money instead of keeping it for yourself leads to the idea that we need to somehow adjust future cash flows to the present when considering how we allocate our money.
