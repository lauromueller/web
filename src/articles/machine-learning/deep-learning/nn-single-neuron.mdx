Test neural network

<CodeHighlighter
  code={`
(function someDemo() {
  var test = "Hello World!";
  console.log(test);
})();\n
const test = "This is a somwhat longer line which should not break into the next line";
return () => <App />;
`}
  language="jsx"
/>

$a + b = c$ and continue writing! The next paragraph is a whole equation

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) = 1
$$

And the equation can also be inline: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) = 1$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
