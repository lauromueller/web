  Measures of risk and return of financial assets are the most important
  indicators in the investment world, and understanding the different metrics
  available out there is essential for anyone who is interested in the field.
  This article provides a detailed overview of multiple risk and return
  measures, as well as a practical approach for their calculation in Python. As
  always, we will go a bit further and discuss several indirect aspects such as
  data acquisition, data preparation, and Python programming.

Returns are among the most fundamental indicators in finance. They measure how much the value of a certain asset has varied over a specific period. A return can be either positive, when the price at the end of the period is higher than the price at the beginning of the period, or negative, when the end price is lower than the starting price.

Risks, while also sharing the same importance as returns when it comes to financial indicators, are somewhat harder to define. The volatility of an asset price (in other words, how much the price varies over time) is normally taken as an indicator of how risky the asset is, but this is not entirely true. For once, we are only worried about risks when they lead to decreases in the asset price (negative returns). Investors are not worried about volatility if the returns are positive; it is the volatility on the negative side that worries us the most. Since simply measuring the volatility of a time-series does not give us a reliable measure of risk, we will have a look at other recommended indicators.

## Characterizing returns of an asset

The first

$$
1 + r = \dfrac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}\\
\;\\
r = \dfrac{P_{t+1}}{P_t} - 1
$$

Formula with dividends (adds the dividends earned between times $t$ and $t+1$):

$$
1 + r = \dfrac{P_{t+1} + D_{t, t+1}}{P_t}\\
\;\\
r = \dfrac{P_{t+1} + D_{t, t+1}}{P_t} - 1
$$
